# seat_finder_app_using_flutter


The development of the seat finder application followed a structured approach that aimed to create a functional, user-friendly, and efficient solution. The methodology involved the following steps:

Requirement Understanding: Understanding the problem statement, including the types of berths and the need for a user-friendly interface to find berth information based on seat numbers.

Choosing the Technology: Selecting the appropriate technology for implementation. Flutter was chosen for the mobile app due to its cross-platform capabilities and reactive UI framework, while Tkinter was used for the Python app due to its simplicity and availability for creating desktop applications.

UI Design: Designing the user interface with simplicity and responsiveness in mind. Creating a clear layout with input fields, buttons, and result displays for ease of use.

Code Structuring: Organizing the code into modular components or functions to promote reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. This involved creating separate functions/classes for UI components, data handling, and user interactions.

Data Handling: Creating a data structure to map seat numbers to berth types. This allowed efficient calculation of berth types based on seat numbers.

Error Handling: Implementing error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as invalid input, non-numeric characters, and out-of-range seat numbers. Providing user-friendly error messages to guide users.

User Interaction: Creating functions to handle user interactions, such as clicking the "Find Berth" button. These functions were responsible for calculating berth types, validating input, and updating the UI with results.

Testing and Refinement: Testing the application with different input scenarios to ensure its correctness and responsiveness. Refining the code based on testing results and feedback.

Documentation: Adding comments and documentation to the code to enhance readability and understanding for both developers and potential users.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to run the seat finder application code for both the Flutter mobile app and the Python desktop app:

Install Flutter by following the instructions on the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Create a new Flutter project using the command:

//flutter create seat_finder_app//

Replace the contents of lib/main.dart with the provided Flutter code.

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the seat_finder_app directory.

Run the app using the command:

//flutter run//

Python Desktop App (Using Tkinter):

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Create a new .py file, e.g., seat_finder_app.py.

Copy and paste the provided Python code into the seat_finder_app.py file.

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the seat_finder_app.py file.

Run the script using the command:
//python seat_finder_app.py//
or

//python3 seat_finder_app.py//

Upon running the application, a graphical user interface will appear. Enter a seat number within the specified range, click the "Find Berth" button, and the application will display the corresponding berth type or an error message.
